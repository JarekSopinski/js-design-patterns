### Definition

A component that processes structured text data. Does so by turning it into separate lexical tokens (lexing) and then interpreting sequences of said tokens (parsing).

### Motivation

Textual input needs to be processed
    - e.g. turned into OOP structures

Some examples
    - programming language compilers, interpreters and IDEs
    - HTML, XML and similar
    - Numeric expressions (3+4/5)
    - Regular expressions

Turning strings into OOP based structures is a complicated process.
