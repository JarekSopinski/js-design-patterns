### Definition

Exposing several components through a single interface.
Facade provides a simple, easy to understand user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.

### Motivation

Balancing complexity and presentation / usability.
Even though interior can be very complex, the end user is not exposed to internals.
API consumers want it to 'just work'.
