### Definition

A construct which adapts and existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.

Sometimes we have to adapt the interface that we are given to the interface that we actually need.

### Caching

Sometimes adapter forces us to generate temporary objects.
To prevent generating temporary objects, we can implement caching.
